# aitherzero — provision any machine from one config file

[AitherZero](https://github.com/Aitherium/AitherZero) (MIT) is the self-service provisioning
surface: a **`config.psd1`** plus a library of **numbered PowerShell automation-scripts** and
playbooks that stand up bare-metal, on-prem, cloud, or hybrid machines. It runs on
**PowerShell 7** everywhere, so the same scripts work on every node.

## Set it up

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Aitherium/AitherZero.git
cd AitherZero
./build.ps1                       # generates AitherZero.psd1 (+ bin/) from src/
Import-Module ./AitherZero.psd1 -Force
```

> **`./build.ps1` is not optional and is easy to miss.** The repo does **not** ship a committed
> `AitherZero.psd1` — `build.ps1` generates it at the repo root and in `bin/`. Skip it and
> `Import-Module ./AitherZero.psd1` fails with "file not found", which reads like a bad clone.
> (The repo's own README also references a `bootstrap.ps1` that is not currently in the public
> tree — use the module commands below instead.)

**Check — this must list scripts, not error:**

```powershell
Get-AitherScript | Select-Object -First 5
```

## Run it

```powershell
Invoke-AitherScript 1002          # run one automation-script by number (1002 = Install-Git)
Invoke-AitherPlaybook node-onboard
Get-AitherPlaybook                # what playbooks are available
Get-AitherScriptMetadata 1002     # what a script does, and its parameters
```

Scripts live under `library/automation-scripts/<category>/NNNN_Verb-Noun.ps1` — the number is the
handle you pass to `Invoke-AitherScript`. Playbooks are `.psd1` files under `library/playbooks/`.

## Configure it

Config layers, so you only override what you need:

```
config.psd1  <  config.<platform>.psd1  <  config/domains/*.psd1  <  config.local.psd1
```

Copy the template and edit only your overrides:

```powershell
Copy-Item config/config.local.template.psd1 config.local.psd1
```

`config/domains/` splits settings by area (`ai`, `automation`, `development`, `infrastructure`,
`reporting`, `security`), and `config.example.psd1` is the annotated reference. Inspect the
resolved result rather than guessing which layer won:

```powershell
Get-AitherConfigs                 # what config is actually in effect
Compare-AitherConfig              # diff layers against each other
```

## Build your config without hand-editing psd1

The config surface is **generated from the script inventory** — every automation-script's
`param()` block becomes a setting — so writing a script with a `param()` block extends AitherZero
automatically. Two tools make that self-service, and both ship in the repo you just cloned:

```powershell
# 1. generate the schema from any inventory — the public library, or your own scripts
pwsh tools/config-editor/Export-AitherConfigSchema.ps1 `
     -ScriptRoot ./library/automation-scripts `
     -PlaybookRoot ./library/playbooks `
     -OutFile tools/config-editor/config-schema.json

# 2. open tools/config-editor/index.html, load config-schema.json, set parameters
#    with enum dropdowns and live trap checks, then export your config.local.psd1
```

A generated `config-schema.json` is committed, so you can open the builder immediately and only
re-run step 1 after you add or change scripts. Point `-ScriptRoot` at your own directory to fold
private automation into the same editor.

**Check — the exporter prints what it found:**

```
Wrote .../config-schema.json — 69 scripts with a configurable surface, 9 categories.
```

## Drive it from an agent

The `aitherzero` tool pack gives an [awdk](awdk.md) agent the same surface as tools,
so an agent can inventory scripts, validate configs, and plan deployments:

```bash
pip install awdk
python -m adk.toolpacks.aitherzero inventory
python -m adk.toolpacks.aitherzero describe 1002
python -m adk.toolpacks.aitherzero validate --path config.local.psd1
```

## What is public, and what isn't

This matters if you are following older write-ups — several describe an internal layout a public
clone does not have:

Everything this skill tells you to run is in the public repo: `build.ps1`, `src/` (the module),
`library/automation-scripts/`, `library/playbooks/`, `config/`, `plugins/`, and
`tools/config-editor/` (the schema exporter + visual Config Builder).

Aitherium runs a larger internal script inventory on top of the same engine, so older write-ups
may quote bigger numbers or reference paths under a dot-prefixed `PRODUCTS`/`DEPLOYMENT` root.
**Those are private-monorepo paths and will not exist in your clone** — every command here is a
public one, verified against this repository.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Import-Module ./AitherZero.psd1` — file not found | skipped the build | run `./build.ps1` first |
| `bootstrap.ps1` not found | not in the public tree | use `Invoke-AitherPlaybook` / `Invoke-AitherScript` |
| A dot-prefixed `PRODUCTS`-style path does nothing | private-monorepo path from an older write-up | use the public paths in this skill |
| Config Builder shows no parameters | `config-schema.json` not loaded, or stale | re-run the exporter, then load the file in the page |
| Script number not found | inventory differs from internal docs | `Get-AitherScript` lists what you actually have |
| Config change has no effect | a higher layer overrides it | `Get-AitherConfigs` / `Compare-AitherConfig` |
