"""docker-net-doctor - find out WHY container networking/DNS is failing.

Written after a session that spent hours on a fleet-wide "intermittent DNS"
fault and reached the wrong conclusion three times. The order of checks below is
the order that would have found it in minutes.

THE HEADLINE FINDING IT ENCODES
-------------------------------
Docker's embedded resolver (127.0.0.11) is a userspace goroutine inside dockerd,
not a kernel service. On one fleet it was measured **failing 38-65% of queries
with clean 2000ms timeouts, sustained** - while the kernel reported zero loss:

    conntrack 11% used, 0 "table full"      <- NOT conntrack
    Udp InErrors=0 RcvbufErrors=0           <- NOT socket buffers
    load 22-32 on 24 cores, container CPU
      sum only 798% of 2400%                <- starved/blocked, not CPU-bound

Two things follow, and both are counter-intuitive:

  1. Nothing in the kernel will ever tell you about this. Every counter is clean.
  2. A *backup* resolver configured `--strict-order --server=127.0.0.11 ...`
     inherits the failure, because strict-order pays the bad upstream's full
     timeout on every cache miss. A backup that fails when the thing it backs up
     fails is not a backup.

You cannot make dockerd faster from inside a container. The durable fix is to
stop asking it: serve container names from a dnsmasq `hostsdir` map so a fleet
lookup never touches 127.0.0.11 at all.

Exit 0 clean, 1 defect found, 2 could-not-determine (which is a FAILURE, not a
pass - a check that cannot run tells you nothing).

# -- ARP TABLE HEADROOM -------------------------------------------------------


def check_arp() -> None:
    """The global ARP table vs the fleet's total entries.

    THE FAULT THIS FINDS, and why it is worth its own check: Linux keeps ONE
    GLOBAL `arp_tbl` whose entry count is shared across EVERY network namespace,
    while `gc_thresh3` -- the ceiling on it -- defaults to 1024. Containers each
    hold their own ARP entries, so on a large single-bridge fleet their SUM
    blows past that ceiling; `neigh_alloc` then refuses new entries and
    whichever container ARPs next simply cannot resolve its next hop.

    It presents as a PER-CONTAINER fault and that is the trap. Measured on a
    187-container fleet (2026-08-02): one container's `getaddrinfo` failed
    INSTANTLY with EAI_AGAIN, it held no ARP entry for either resolver, and raw
    UDP *and* TCP :53 both timed out -- while it was `Up (healthy)`, its
    resolv.conf was byte-identical to a working container's, and the resolver
    answered a peer on the same bridge in 12ms.

    A `--force-recreate` "fixed" it every time, which is exactly why the real
    cause hid for weeks: a recreate CHURNS neighbour entries and frees table
    space, so the container comes back 0/6 -> 6/6 and the limit refills minutes
    later. The measured fleet total was ~2000 entries against the 1024 ceiling.
    Raising the thresholds fixed the container with NO recreate at all, and
    simultaneously fixed an unrelated container that could not reach the Docker
    proxy -- one kernel tunable, two "separate" outages.

    Nothing else can see it: every per-container signal is green, the resolver
    is genuinely healthy, and the only evidence is a kernel ring-buffer line.
