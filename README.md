**Learn to run coding agents at program scale — from measured telemetry, not vibes.**
Free, MIT-licensed. The operating doctrine, plus 40+ battle-tested skills.

Most advice about working with AI coding agents is somebody's feeling. This repo is one
operator's logs: **27,939 prompts across 3,183 sessions over 210 days**, re-measured on a
disjoint 34-day window (5,244 human prompts, 9,715 machine-written agent dispatches), then
distilled into rules you can install into your own setup in about ten minutes.

Everything here came out of running a real platform — 260 services, ~166 containers, three
repos — with agents doing most of the typing. The skills are the parts that survived.

## 📖 The Developer Codex — start here if you want the whole thing

**[Read it online →](https://aitherium.github.io/awskills/codex.html)** · **[Read it in the repo →](codex/)**

The skills below are procedures. The Codex is the *doctrine underneath them* — what
makes a codebase run by agents get **harder to break over time** instead of quietly
rotting while every dashboard stays green.

| | |
|---|---|
| **[The path](codex/path/00-what-this-actually-is.md)** — 4 chapters, ~1 hour | Never used a coding agent? From nothing to one real, verified change on your own repository. Then local models, then tools/skills/packs. |
| **[The eighteen laws](codex/README.md#the-eighteen-laws)** | Every one was a real failure first. Grouped into Enforcement · Silence · Adoption · Deployment · Trust. |

The laws in one line each:

> **Enforcement** — a rule nothing asserts is a suggestion · make it a check, not a
> ticket · watch your gate fail · mutate the test, not just the code
>
> **Silence** — design for the silence · a check that cannot run must not pass · the
> symptom names the innocent · a checker in the wrong place found nothing · detection
> without delivery is not detection
>
> **Adoption** — a gate that floods gets switched off · open green, ratchet down ·
> measure it again
>
> **Deployment** — written is not deployed · you wrote it, that does not mean it ships ·
> generate, never copy · the defect lives in the union
>
> **Trust** — fail closed, then prove the happy path · never trust the caller for an
> authorization decision

**Why this exists.** The failures that cost days do not throw. They return 200, render
correctly, log nothing, and leave the container healthy — a missing thing is
indistinguishable from a thing nobody wanted. Eighteen laws is what it took to make a
system able to notice.

## 🧠 Start here — code like this

| Skill | What it teaches |
|---|---|
| [`code-like-david`](skills/code-like-david.md) | **The doctrine.** 13 measured rules for running an agent at program scale: prompt shape, live-proof gates, plan documents as files not modes, persistent memory with an index, when to orchestrate vs stay solo, when to compact, how to route models. Installs itself into your rules/memory/plans directories without overwriting anything. |
| [`ramble-driven-development`](skills/ramble-driven-development.md) | **The prompt-shape law.** Median human prompt: **56 characters**. But the 5.9% over 1,000 chars carry **78% of everything typed**. Ramble to load intent, poke to steer, and put the precision in the harness — 90% of machine-written dispatches name a file path against 6% of human ones. Includes how to mine *your* transcripts, and the two filters that otherwise inflate your median by 33x. |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aitherium/awskills
cd awskills
bash scripts/install-awskills.sh          # Windows: pwsh -File scripts/Install-AitherSkills.ps1
```

Then tell your agent: **"use the code-like-david skill"**.

> **The one rule to take away if you read nothing else:** the careful, fully-specified
> prompt still has to exist — you just shouldn't be the one typing it. Put your standards
> in a rules file once, add a gate that can fail, and your prompts collapse to
> "get it done." **You don't type your standards. You install them.**
>
> ⚠️ Doing this on a bare setup with no gates produces confident garbage at speed. Build
> the gate first. Both skills say so up front.

## 🚀 Then — run the agent on your own hardware, free

If you have a computer and access to an AI agent, you can run your own agent on your own
hardware, for free, today. Install the pack and open the front door:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aitherium/awskills
cd awskills
bash scripts/install-awskills.sh          # Windows: pwsh -File scripts/Install-AitherSkills.ps1
```

Then tell your agent: **"use the aither-start skill"**.

| Skill | What it gets you |
|---|---|
| [`aither-start`](skills/aither-start.md) | **The front door.** Zero → working agent on your own machine: detect the hardware, install the toolkit, run a model that actually fits, wire it into the agent you already use. Every step ends in a check that can fail. |
| [`local-inference`](skills/local-inference.md) | A language model on your box for **$0** — pick Ollama / llama.cpp / vLLM for the machine you *have*, size the model so it doesn't OOM, serve it OpenAI-compatible, prove it with a real round-trip. Includes tool-calling setup and the failure modes that look like success. |
| [`install-skills`](skills/install-skills.md) | Install this pack into **any** agent — Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, Cursor, Goose, Codex, Gemini CLI. Explains the two layouts (`SKILL.md` folder vs flat slash-command) and why the wrong one makes an agent "not see" skills that are right there. |
| [`repo-is-not-a-runtime`](skills/repo-is-not-a-runtime.md) | **The doctrine underneath the cleanup.** Two rules: a repo is a *source artifact*, not a runtime; and every ephemeral an agent creates needs an owner, a TTL and a **reaper**. Measured: a checkout that was **0.4% `.git`** and 99.6% runtime data + agent debris. Ships [`repo-hygiene-audit.sh`](tools/repo-hygiene-audit.sh) — a gate that *fails*, because doctrine without a gate is a wish. |
| [`agent-disk-hygiene`](skills/agent-disk-hygiene.md) | **Your agents are quietly eating your disk.** A real checkout grew to **1.15 TB** — of which `.git` was **4.7 GB**; the rest was agent debris, led by **295 GB of abandoned worktrees**. How to reap them safely, and the `git log --branches` trap that makes every worktree look dirty forever so nothing ever gets cleaned. Ships [`agent-worktree-reaper.sh`](tools/agent-worktree-reaper.sh). |
| [`concurrent-safe-git`](skills/concurrent-safe-git.md) | **You do not have this working tree to yourself.** The moment two agents (or an agent and a cron loop) share a checkout, ordinary git turns destructive: a bare `git commit` ships whatever *somebody else* staged. Two real incidents — a `reset --hard` that wiped a session's uncommitted work and **re-deployed an already-fixed data leak**, and a 10-line fix that committed **270 lines**. The pathspec commit form, the four commands to never run, and the `git update-index --refresh` trick for a merge git only *thinks* is unsafe (measured: 7 blocked files, 1 real, all 7 kept their content). |
| [`docker-wsl2-disk-reclaim`](skills/docker-wsl2-disk-reclaim.md) | Your drive is full, you pruned 200GB, and nothing changed. Docker Desktop's VHDX **never shrinks** — its data disk is mounted without `discard`. The three-layer accounting model (VHDX 2.0TB ≥ ext4 1.6TB ≥ `docker system df` 634GB), why `fstrim` before compaction is mandatory, and why moving the file to another drive doesn't help. Ships [`docker-wsl2-reclaim.sh`](tools/docker-wsl2-reclaim.sh). |
| [`docker-wsl2-build-safety`](skills/docker-wsl2-build-safety.md) | Stop bulk image builds from crashing Docker Desktop's WSL2 backend and taking every container down — plus the day-distribution check that tells a **VM storage collapse** apart from a **failing disk**. They look identical: 44k disk I/O errors in an hour, `Device offlined`, "Docker Desktop is unable to start". One is a config problem; the other is a hardware purchase. |
| [`docker-network-ops`](skills/docker-network-ops.md) | **Container DNS lies to you.** Docker's embedded resolver `127.0.0.11` is a goroutine inside `dockerd`, not a kernel service — measured **failing 38–65% of queries with clean 2s timeouts, sustained**, while conntrack sat at 11% and `Udp InErrors=0`. Why no kernel counter will ever show it, why musl/glibc/nginx each fail differently in the *same* container, the silent `--bind-interfaces` race that leaves dnsmasq `Up (healthy)` serving nothing, and the six measurement traps that each produced a confident wrong answer. Ships [`docker-net-doctor.py`](tools/docker-net-doctor.py). |
| [`openclaw`](skills/openclaw.md) | Install [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), point it at *your* model instead of a paid API, and connect the AitherOS toolset with one command (`aither integrate openclaw`). |
| [`hermes-agent`](skills/hermes-agent.md) | Install [Nous Research's Hermes](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent) — self-improving, persistent memory, cron automation — on your own inference. Includes the two config shapes that **silently do nothing** if you get them wrong. |
| [`tau`](skills/tau.md) | Install [Tau](https://github.com/wizzense/tau) — a minimalist Python terminal coding agent — on your own model via `~/.tau/catalog.toml`. Includes the folder-only skill layout tau enforces (bare `.md` is silently skipped) and the `/skill:name` invocation. |
| [`deer-flow`](skills/deer-flow.md) | Run [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) — ByteDance's LangGraph super-agent harness for long autonomous research/coding runs — on your own endpoint, with MCP servers and per-tool timeouts. |
| [`ods`](skills/ods.md) | Stand up [ODS](https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS): **one installer** turns a PC/Mac/Linux box into a private AI server — inference, chat UI, voice, agents, workflows, RAG, image gen, all in Docker, CPU fallback included. |
| [`ship-an-app-free`](skills/ship-an-app-free.md) | Idea → working app → **public URL**, on free tiers only. GitHub Pages + Actions, Cloudflare Workers when you need a backend. No credit card, no server to rent. |
| [`github-actions-image-pipeline`](skills/github-actions-image-pipeline.md) | **Build once, deploy many.** GitHub Actions has no cross-workflow dependency, so two workflows that both build an image build it **twice on every push** — and an ML base is a **40–56 minute** build, cold. The division-of-labor fix: one workflow builds, deployers `docker buildx imagetools create`-retag the `:latest` in seconds. Plus the 10GB cache that evicts your base, the disk-reclaim an ML base needs on a hosted runner, the `actions: read` permission `github-script` silently needs, and the **never-exercised-path chain** — every step a workflow never ran fails on a real latent bug the first time it runs. |

**Everything above is free.** No paid API key is required anywhere in that path.

### Installing into your agent

The [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard wants `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; Claude Code
slash commands want a flat `.claude/commands/<name>.md`. This repo ships flat files and the
installer converts per target — so you don't have to care:

```bash
bash scripts/install-awskills.sh --list                 # what's detected
bash scripts/install-awskills.sh --dry-run              # show, write nothing
bash scripts/install-awskills.sh --target openclaw      # just one agent
bash scripts/install-awskills.sh --only local-inference # just one skill
```

Nothing is overwritten without `--force`, so re-running is safe. Full per-agent path table in
[`install-skills`](skills/install-skills.md).

## Skills

### 🐳 `recover-docker` — un-wedge Docker Desktop's WSL2 engine

Docker Desktop on Windows wedges its WSL2 Linux engine: the `docker` API returns **`500 Internal Server Error`**, or `docker stop`/recreate dies with **`tried to kill container, but did not receive an exit event`** (common on nvidia-runtime / GPU containers). The GUI looks healthy; the daemon is dead.

`scripts/Recover-Docker.ps1` does a complete teardown **in the right order** — kill the UI + backends → `wsl --shutdown` → reap `vmmem`/`wslservice` zombies → bounce the Windows services → cold-start Docker Desktop → wait for the engine → clean dead containers + restart exited ones. **No reboot, container volumes intact, healthy in ~30–60s.**

**Run it directly:**
```powershell
# one-shot recovery (run elevated for the service bounce)
pwsh -File scripts/Recover-Docker.ps1

# 30s watchdog — auto-recovers on failure
pwsh -File scripts/Recover-Docker.ps1 -Monitor
```

**As a Claude Code skill:** copy `skills/recover-docker.md` into your project's `.claude/commands/` and `scripts/Recover-Docker.ps1` somewhere on disk, then run `/recover-docker` (or `/recover-docker --monitor`). The agent detects the wedge, runs recovery, verifies with `docker version` / `docker ps`, and reports which containers came back.

📖 Background: [Self-Healing Docker: One Command to Un-Wedge the WSL2 Engine](https://aitherium.com/blog/recovering-docker-from-the-wsl2-wedge/)

### 🛡️ `moat-guard` — keep private code out of your public package

Open-core release hygiene. Three parameterized tools (nothing project-specific — every rule is a flag) plus a `/moat-guard` skill that drives them:

| Tool | Job |
|------|-----|
| [`tools/check_package_leaks.py`](tools/check_package_leaks.py) | **Pre-publish gate.** Inspect a built wheel/sdist; fail (non-zero exit) if it bundles forbidden files/imports or is missing a required keystone. Drop it in CI before `twine upload`. |
| [`tools/find_leaky_releases.py`](tools/find_leaky_releases.py) | **Audit what already shipped.** List index versions below a cutoff and, with `--verify`, download each wheel to *prove* the leak. Prints the exact yank checklist (indexes have no yank API). |
| [`tools/purge_public_leaks.sh`](tools/purge_public_leaks.sh) | **Scrub the public GitHub surface.** Delete pre-cutoff releases + tags and filter a leaked file out of the repo's entire history (mirror force-push). Dry-run by default. |

```bash
# CI gate: fail the build if it bundles secrets or imports an internal package
python tools/check_package_leaks.py dist/mypkg-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl \
  --forbid-path '*/secrets*.py' --forbid-import mycorp_internal \
  --require-file '*/licensing.py'

# Audit a published project and prove which versions leak
python tools/find_leaky_releases.py mypkg --cutoff 2.0.0 --verify \
  --forbid-path '*/nanogpt.py'

# Plan a purge (dry-run), then execute once you've read it
bash tools/purge_public_leaks.sh --repo me/mypkg --keep-from 2.0.0 --leak-path src/secret.py
bash tools/purge_public_leaks.sh --repo me/mypkg --keep-from 2.0.0 --leak-path src/secret.py \
  --execute --rewrite-history          # irreversible — breaks pinned installs & forks
```

**As a Claude Code skill:** copy `skills/moat-guard.md` into `.claude/commands/` and run `/moat-guard check` (pre-publish), `/moat-guard find` (audit), or `/moat-guard purge` (destructive — always dry-runs first, confirms before force-pushing).

> ⚠️ Purging shrinks exposure but **cannot un-distribute** what already shipped. If a removed file carried a secret, rotate it.

### 🗜️ `model-quantization` — shrink an LLM to 4-bit, locally and free

Make a model fit where bf16 won't — on a smaller GPU, or beside another model on
the same card. [`tools/quantize_model.py`](tools/quantize_model.py) drives
[AutoRound](https://github.com/intel/auto-round) and bakes in the gotchas that
otherwise produce a broken or un-loadable artifact.

The default is **RTN** (round-to-nearest, `--iters 0`): weight-only, no
calibration data, no forward pass, ~<2 GB peak VRAM, ~1 minute. It runs on your
**CPU + GPU together** (host-RAM offload) — `$0`, fully local, and enough for
most models. Calibrated AWQ (`--iters > 0`) is higher quality but needs a real
GPU, and is **refused on architectures whose calibrated path crashes** (per-layer
head dims) with a clear steer back to RTN.

```bash
# Preview the plan — no weight load, no GPU, no write
python tools/quantize_model.py google/gemma-3-12b-it --dry-run

# RTN 4-bit, local + free (keeps lm_head + multimodal projectors in bf16)
python tools/quantize_model.py google/gemma-3-12b-it -o ./gemma-3-12b-it-awq

# Calibrated AWQ on a GPU (refused on het-head models — use RTN there)
python tools/quantize_model.py mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 \
  -o ./mistral-7b-awq --iters 200 --nsamples 128
```

What it gets right for you: uses **AutoRound, not llm-compressor** (which silently
downgrades `transformers`); keeps **`lm_head` + vision/audio projectors in bf16**
(vLLM loaders require it); exports **`compressed-tensors`** so un-quantized modules
stay plain; and **detects heterogeneous head dims** to avoid the calibrated-mode
crash. Serve the result with `vllm serve <outdir> --quantization awq_marlin`.

**As a Claude Code skill:** copy `skills/model-quantization.md` into
`.claude/commands/` and `tools/quantize_model.py` onto disk, then run
`/model-quantization <model-id> -o <outdir>`. The agent dry-runs first, runs RTN
by default, and reports the output path + serve command. Needs
`pip install auto-round torch transformers`.

### 🗜️ `aither-headroom` — cut agent token cost with reversible context compression

Agents burn most of their tokens re-sending bulky context — verbose JSON tool output, retrieved
docs, file dumps. [headroom](https://github.com/wizzense/headroom) (`headroom-ai`) crushes that
content with a SmartCrusher pipeline — **measured ~46% token savings on an 87 KB tool blob** —
while *protecting* conversation/user text so answers don't degrade. Two ways in: an **automatic**
pre-send hook at the single LLM chokepoint (flag-gated, graceful no-op — if the sidecar is off,
calls just proceed uncompressed), and **agent-callable** tools (`headroom_compress(content)`,
`headroom_stats()`) from the free `headroom` tool pack.

```bash
export AITHER_HEADROOM_ENABLED=true              # turn on the automatic pre-send hook
curl http://127.0.0.1:8788/health                # sidecar healthy? → {"ok":true,"headroom":"0.25.0"}
# prove the savings on a realistic payload before trusting the ratio
```

Give an adk agent the tools self-service with `apply_pack_self("headroom")` (free, no entitlement).
Present bulky context as the `content` blob (conversation text is protected and barely compresses;
below ~800 chars it no-ops). See [`skills/aither-headroom.md`](skills/aither-headroom.md).

### 🔄 `resume-all` — bring back every Claude Code session you lost

A reboot, a crash, or a closed terminal and your Claude Code conversations are gone — not
deleted, just *unfindable*. You reopen N terminals, `cd` into each project, run `claude`,
then `/resume` and squint at a list of UUIDs trying to remember which was which.

[`scripts/Resume-ClaudeSessions.ps1`](scripts/Resume-ClaudeSessions.ps1) reads Claude Code's
own session journals (`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`), recovers each
session's **AI title, last prompt, working directory, git branch and last-active time**, lets
you pick, and reopens them — each in its own terminal tab or tmux window. Read-only against
your history; it never mutates the journals.

```bash
# interactive picker — choose which to bring back
pwsh -File scripts/Resume-ClaudeSessions.ps1

# reopen the most-recent session for every project directory, no prompt
pwsh -File scripts/Resume-ClaudeSessions.ps1 -PerDir -All

# only sessions matching some text, from the last day
pwsh -File scripts/Resume-ClaudeSessions.ps1 -Filter payments -LookbackHours 24

# over SSH? resume into tmux — the windows survive a disconnect
pwsh -File scripts/Resume-ClaudeSessions.ps1 -Tmux -Select 1,3
```

**Cross-platform** (PowerShell 7): Windows Terminal tabs on Windows, tmux windows anywhere,
Terminal.app on macOS — and if none of those exist it prints the commands rather than
pretending it launched something. `-DryRun` prints the resolved session ids to stdout.

> ⚠️ The gotcha this exists to solve: sub-agent sidechains (`agent-*.jsonl`) and workflow
> journals are rewritten constantly, so by write-time they **crowd out your real sessions**.
> A naive "most recently modified N journals" scan surfaces almost none of them. This filters
> to genuine top-level conversations *before* truncating the scan window.

> ⚠️ Second gotcha, fixed in the engine: resumed tabs used to come up **fully monochrome**
> whenever you launched them from inside a Claude Code session. Claude Code exports
> `NO_COLOR=1` to its subprocesses so tool output comes back clean — and the terminal this
> engine spawns is one of those subprocesses, so the new window, every shell in it, and every
> `claude` inside those shells inherited it. It looks exactly like a terminal-theme problem and
> is not one. The engine now scrubs the variable per tab. If you edit the launch command, keep
> that scrub — and **delete** the variable rather than blanking it, since the check is
> `!("NO_COLOR" in process.env)` (presence, not value), so `NO_COLOR=""` still kills colour.

**As a Claude Code skill:** copy `skills/resume-all.md` into `.claude/commands/` and the script
onto disk, then run `/resume-all` (or `/resume-all all`, or `/resume-all <filter text>`).

### 🕸️ `omninode-node` — join the OmniNode P2P inference mesh in one command

[OmniNode Protocol](https://github.com/SUM-INNOVATION/OmniNode-Protocol) (by **SUM-INNOVATION**) is a
trustless, peer-to-peer network that pools ordinary machines into a fabric big enough to run models no
single device could hold — *any device with a chip can become a node*. Standing one up shouldn't be a
ten-step wiki page.

[`scripts/omninode-node-up.sh`](scripts/omninode-node-up.sh) takes a fresh machine (Linux / macOS /
Windows-WSL2) from **nothing installed → a live, discoverable node**: detect hardware → install Rust if
missing → clone + build `omni-node` → verify two peers discover each other over libp2p/mDNS (or `--listen`
to run a persistent node). If [awdk](https://github.com/Aitherium/awdk) is present it can also
`adk mesh onboard` the node so your agents use it — one motion, not two projects.

```bash
./scripts/omninode-node-up.sh          # build + self-verify P2P discovery
./scripts/omninode-node-up.sh --listen # run a persistent mesh node
./scripts/omninode-node-up.sh --adk    # + enroll into AitherMesh for adk agents
```

Verified end-to-end on a 12-core Linux box: clone → build → `NODE OK`, P2P discovery live. See
[`skills/omninode-node.md`](skills/omninode-node.md). No credentials, no account, no central server.

### 🧩 The Aither substrate — set up and use awdk, AwNode, AitherConnect, AitherZero & AitherMesh

Five skills for the coherent substrate the OmniNode node plugs into. Each is a "set it up, then use
it" guide grounded in real commands — standing up compute and having your agents use it is one
motion, not five projects.

| Skill | What it sets up |
|-------|-----------------|
| [`awdk`](skills/awdk.md) | The agent toolkit — `pip install awdk` → `adk onboard --quick` → `adk run`. Your model, your loop, your data on your box; manage from the portal. |
| [`aither-discord-agent`](skills/aither-discord-agent.md) | Deploy any awdk agent as a **Discord bot** with one automated onboarding command — `adk onboard --discord` installs your pack, validates the bot token live, prints the invite link, verifies identity/tools, and launches. Every DM/@mention runs your agent's own loop. No paid tier needed (hand-rolled fallback). |
| [`awnode`](skills/awnode.md) | The *body* — a local MCP server (`adk mcp node`) exposing GPU, local inference, ComfyUI, and files to agents; or bootstrap the box as a full inference node. |
| [`aitherconnect`](skills/aitherconnect.md) | The seam — `adk connect` / `adk mesh onboard` (`--headscale` behind NAT) to wire a machine, agent, and browser into AitherOS and the mesh. |
| [`aitherzero`](skills/aitherzero.md) | The provisioner — one `config.psd1` + `bootstrap.ps1` to stand up bare-metal/on-prem/cloud/hybrid, with a generated-from-inventory config editor and `az_*` agent tools. |
| [`aithermesh`](skills/aithermesh.md) | The fabric — one playbook (`Invoke-AitherPlaybook deploy-mesh-agent`) to create a private WireGuard mesh, join nodes to the overlay, and deploy agents onto them; nodes defined in `config/nodes.yaml`. |
| [`bonsai-27b`](skills/bonsai-27b.md) | A model to run on a node — PrismML's 1-bit Bonsai-27B (`Q1_0`, 3.8 GB) served on a plain CPU box via the PrismML llama.cpp fork; a 27B model on a laptop. |
| [`graph-rag-agent`](skills/graph-rag-agent.md) | Knowledge on tap — `adk ingest` a folder/codebase into a knowledge graph, then an agent (`adk create-app` + `recall`/`search_knowledge`) that answers from *your* material. Local-first graph RAG, no separate vector DB. |
| [`graph-a-repo`](skills/graph-a-repo.md) | The *operational runbook* — graph a repo OR a KB end-to-end and **prove both halves**: the embedder returns the right-dimension vector (`rag_verify_embedder`, 768 for nomic-embed-text) AND retrieval returns the ingested content (`rag_verify_retrieval` — an empty graph answers `200` with zero hits). Picks code (CodeRankEmbed + `codegraph_*`) vs prose (nomic-embed-text) embedder; bakes in the traps (code≠text vector spaces, fleet-vector parity, `adk chat` not `adk query`). Front door for the `graphrag` toolpack. |
| [`aither-code-intelligence`](skills/aither-code-intelligence.md) | The *operational* layer — how to run prospector+codegraph+headroom for real and **prove they still work**. A 60-second health check, nine silent failure modes with the symptom you actually see (stale paths, orphaned embeddings, mount traps, self-healers killing slow indexers, `OOMKilled=false` hiding a real OOM), and why hybrid search needs Reciprocal Rank Fusion (measured F1 0.083 → 0.293 → 0.470). Every bug in it reported *healthy* while broken. |
| [`aither-codegraph`](skills/aither-codegraph.md) | The *what* — a call-graph-aware code index. `adk run` auto-indexes a Python project; agents gain `code_search`/`code_context` (symbols, signatures, callers, callees, blast radius). Fleet path: the managed CodeGraph service + `codegraph_*` MCP tools. |
| [`aither-prospector`](skills/aither-prospector.md) | The *where* — a semantic file-explorer. `apply_pack_self("prospector")` → `map_build(repo)` then `map_localize("where is auth?")` returns the dirs to search first, so CodeGraph/grep only look where it matters. Free pack, dependency-free builder. |
| [`aither-agent-notebook`](skills/aither-agent-notebook.md) | The *reviewable unit of work* — turn "build X" into a runnable `.anb` **Agent Notebook** of typed cells (plan / prompt / tool_call / agent_delegate / human `checkpoint` / result). `adk notebook plan "…"` → `run` → `status` → `export` to Jupyter; every run is cost-tracked and can be replayed/diffed against a baseline. Six agent tools (`notebook_*`) proxy the Genesis `/notebooks` API. The durable counterpart to a one-shot `adk forge`. |

### More skills (drop into `.claude/commands/`)

Generic, project-agnostic slash commands — pure prompt-skills, no code or dependencies:

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| [`secretguard`](skills/secretguard.md) | Scan git history for leaked secrets with **gitleaks**; purge a file from history (filter-repo) or allowlist a false positive. Never echoes secret values. |
| [`security-audit`](skills/security-audit.md) | Code + dependency + config audit against the OWASP Top 10 — injection, crypto, access control, secret exposure — with severity-ranked findings. |
| [`dependencies`](skills/dependencies.md) | Audit / update / prune dependencies and check licenses across pip, npm/yarn, and Docker base images (`pip-audit`, `npm audit`, `safety`). |
| [`performance`](skills/performance.md) | Profile and optimize: `cProfile`/`memory_profiler`, hotspot hunting, caching, N+1 queries, algorithmic complexity. Measure first. |
| [`refactor`](skills/refactor.md) | Apply clean-code refactors — extract method, replace conditionals with polymorphism, simplify nested logic — without changing behavior. |
| [`compare-versions`](skills/compare-versions.md) | Diff two versions of a file/commit/release: structural + behavioral changes, breaking-change risk, and a migration checklist. |

## Standalone tools

CLI utilities you can run directly — all parameterized, no AitherOS dependency:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| [`tools/check_exports.py`](tools/check_exports.py) | Validate a Python package: `__all__` entries that don't resolve (ghost exports), `__version__` vs `pyproject.toml` drift, and orphan modules nothing imports. Stdlib-only. |
| [`tools/validate_compose_ports.py`](tools/validate_compose_ports.py) | Lint docker-compose for **host-port collisions** (across one or many `-f` files), malformed mappings, and unpublished container ports. `--strict` to fail CI. |
| [`tools/Backup-DockerVolumes.ps1`](tools/Backup-DockerVolumes.ps1) | Snapshot Docker named volumes → timestamped `.tgz` + `manifest.json`, via a throwaway Alpine container. `-Pattern`/`-SkipPattern`/`-DryRun`, auto-prunes old snapshots. |
| [`tools/quantize_model.py`](tools/quantize_model.py) | Quantize an LLM to 4-bit with AutoRound. **RTN runs free on local CPU+GPU** (`--iters 0`, default); keeps `lm_head`/multimodal projectors in bf16, exports `compressed-tensors`, and refuses calibrated mode on het-head architectures that would crash. `--dry-run` to preview. |

### PowerShell dev utilities ([`tools/powershell/`](tools/powershell/))

Standalone PS7 helpers — no module, no setup, just `pwsh -File`:

| Script | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `Invoke-FileGrep.ps1` | Recursive regex content search with context lines. |
| `Invoke-BulkReplace.ps1` | Regex find/replace across globs, with `-DryRun` and backreferences. |
| `Invoke-FileDiff.ps1` | Unified diff of two files (or inline strings). |
| `Invoke-FileSplice.ps1` | Surgically replace a line range in a text file. |
| `New-GitBranch.ps1` | Create a branch with a conventional prefix (configurable). |
| `New-GitCommit.ps1` | Stage + commit with Conventional Commits validation. |

## The aw family

Standalone tools that share one idea: **replace something you would otherwise have to _trust_ with something you can _check_.**

Each installs on its own, works offline, and needs no account.

| | instead of trusting | you check |
|---|---|---|
| [awdk](https://github.com/Aitherium/awdk) | a framework's idea of how your agents should run | one loop you can read, pointed at a backend you already pay for |
| **awskills** _(you are here)_ | that an agent knows your procedure | the procedure written down, versioned, and loadable by any agent |
| [awpack](https://github.com/Aitherium/awpack) | that the pack you want shipped inside somebody's SDK, under whatever licence that SDK happens to carry | the pack as its own versioned artifact, with its own licence, that any agent runtime can install |
| [awm](https://github.com/Aitherium/awm) | that memory stayed in its lane | tenant:user:project scopes, so a write cannot cross a boundary |
| [awnode](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnode) | a vendor's cloud with every prompt | a local gateway routing to backends you chose |
| [awgraph](https://github.com/Aitherium/awgraph) | that grep found everything | an AST + tree-sitter call graph an agent can traverse |

| [awtoll](https://github.com/Aitherium/awtoll) | that your tooling is saving you context | the measured token cost of each tool call, and what the alternative cost |
| [awseal](https://github.com/Aitherium/awseal) | that the artifact came from who you think | an Ed25519 seal — the key that verifies is not the key that forges |
| [awshare](https://github.com/Aitherium/awshare) | that the download is intact | content-addressed bundles, verified on fetch |
| [awnest](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnest) | that there is a person on the other end | a verdict with evidence, where "we could not tell" is not "yes" |
| [awnboard](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnboard) | a share link anyone who sees it can use | an invitation addressed to one person, for one gate, revocable |
| [awnix](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnix) | that the box is what you left it as | an immutable image you built, with atomic rollback |
| [awrecover](https://github.com/Aitherium/awrecover) | that the restore worked | a restore that fully lands or does not land at all |
| [awrelay](https://github.com/Aitherium/awrelay) | a SaaS in the middle of your agents | findings, alerts and coordination over your own transport |
| [awmail](https://github.com/Aitherium/awmail) | a mailbox somebody else can read | mail your agents send and receive over your own server |
| [awfind](https://github.com/Aitherium/awfind) | one vendor's idea of the web | results from whichever providers you configured |

| [aitherkvcache](https://github.com/Aitherium/aitherkvcache) | a vendor's quantisation defaults | sub-byte KV cache kernels you can benchmark yourself |
| [AitherZero](https://github.com/Aitherium/AitherZero) | a pile of scripts nobody has numbered | numbered, discoverable automation with declarative playbooks |
| [AitherConnect](https://github.com/Aitherium/AitherConnect) | what a page tells your browser to do | a federated search and desktop bridge you host |
| [awreason](https://github.com/Aitherium/awreason) | a confident paragraph | the phases it went through, and every tool call it made to get there |
| [awrecurse](https://github.com/Aitherium/awrecurse) | that everything you pasted in was actually read | which slices it opened, and what it concluded from each |
| [awprism](https://github.com/Aitherium/awprism) | the first explanation that fits | the ranked alternatives, and the observation that separates them |
| [awrepl](https://github.com/Aitherium/awrepl) | what the agent believes the value is | the value, printed from the live session |
| [awresearch](https://github.com/Aitherium/awresearch) | a summary of pages nobody opened | every claim against the source it came from |
| [awpredict](https://github.com/Aitherium/awpredict) | a model because it trained without erroring | its prediction against a self-updating lookup, on the rows that are actually novel |
| [awsh](https://github.com/Aitherium/awsh) | that you already know the name of the command | what it decided your line meant, before it acts on it |
| [awkno](https://github.com/Aitherium/awkno) | that the docs site is up, or that you remember the family | the whole ecosystem in your terminal, with no network at all |

[**awnix**](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnix) is the ground floor — A Linux you can hand to an agent — immutable base, capabilities included.
